# hxsdl_ttf

Haxe/hxcpp @:native bindings for [SDL TTF](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf).

---

This library only works with the Haxe `cpp` target via `hxcpp`.

Keep in mind that not everything in SDL TTF will be included nor will they all work!
If you notice something is broken or is missing, make an issue/pull request.
